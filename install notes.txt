Copy/Zip this folder, then unpack on the target machine.
Don't need to copy node_modules.
Ensure nodejs installed.
Run npm install to install all local dependencies present in project.json
Install global dependencies:
    npm install pm2 -g
    npm install pm2-windows-startup -g
Tell pm2 to automatically run and resurrect (i.e. bring all registered processes online) when Windows starts:
    pm2-startup install
    (This just places a batch file essentially in the user startup folder to run pm2 resurrect)
Run the app through pm2:
    pm2 start app.js
Then make pm2 look after it persistently through server restarts
    pm2 save

Notes:
    So - the web server is being run as an application - not as windows service.
